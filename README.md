# GeoTitan

Quickly download geojsons from servers (REST)

## Current Features
Asynchronously download geojsons using queries from ArcGIS REST servers using result offsets.

## Planned Features
Download multiple geojsons at the same time (with the option to spread out concurrent tasks to not overload one single server)
Download as many states' data as possible.
Process and optimize data. (for example, reduce instances of atomical coordinates) 
Quickly search through the data, with advanced queries. 

pyesridump is a similar tool focused on downloading the same data.

### update??
I am currently busy with school and I do not know how to code at all, I have a vision and copilot to barely help me out.
Feel free to contribute...
